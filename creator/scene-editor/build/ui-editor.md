# UI Editor

The UI Editor lets you build your scene's on-screen interface by dragging widgets onto a canvas, instead of writing layout code by hand. It writes real files into your scene, so anything you make here is normal SDK7 UI that you can keep editing in code.

## Open it

Use the **2D** / **3D** switch at the top of the editor's left panel. **3D** is the scene canvas you already know. **2D** is the UI Editor.

![The 2D and 3D tab switch, with 3D selected.](../../images/editor/ui-editor-mode-switch.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**📔 Note**: The UI Editor needs `@dcl/sdk` version 7.26.0 or newer in your scene. On an older scene the **2D** tab shows a **UI Editor Unavailable** notice instead of the canvas, with an **Update SDK** button that upgrades the scene for you and a **Maybe later** button to dismiss it.
{% endhint %}

The Creator Hub remembers whether you left a scene in 2D or 3D and reopens it the same way. This is stored per project and is never published with your scene.

If you are using the Bevy scene renderer, switching to **2D** pauses the running scene, and going back to **3D** resumes it if it was running before.

## Make your first UI

1. Switch to the **2D** tab.
2. Click **New GUI**, either the button in the middle of the empty canvas or the **+** next to **GUIs** in the left panel. A GUI is one UI component, stored in its own file.
3. Drag a widget from the palette along the bottom onto the canvas. **Full Screen** is a good first widget, it gives you a root that covers the screen. Then drop other widgets inside it.
4. Select a widget and set its properties in the right panel.

There is no save button. The editor writes your changes to disk as you go, and the badge at the left of the toolbar reads **All changes saved**.

## The panels

* **Left**: **GUIs**, the list of your UI components, and **Nodes**, the tree of the selected one. A search box filters both. Hover a node to lock, hide or delete it.
* **Right**: a **Properties** tab for the selected node, and a **Logic** tab.
* **Bottom**: the widget palette. Drag a card onto the canvas to add it.
* **Middle**: the canvas. Drag nodes to move them, use the handles to resize, and pan freely with the mouse wheel or by dragging.

Two floating groups of controls sit in the bottom-right corner of the canvas:

* The **preview** group toggles the mobile HUD guides and the safe-area guides, and switches between **Desktop preview** and **Mobile preview**.
* The **zoom** group has a minus and a plus button, and a percentage readout. Click the percentage to reset the view.

## Widgets

![The widget palette along the bottom of the UI Editor, with cards for Full Screen, Container, Image, Label, Button, Input and Dropdown.](../../images/editor/ui-editor-palette.png)

The palette groups widgets into three categories:

* **Containers**: **Full Screen**, **Container**, **Image**
* **Text**: **Label**, **Button**
* **Input**: **Input**, **Dropdown**

**Full Screen** is a container that fills whatever it is placed inside, which makes it a good starting point for a UI that should cover the screen.

## Moving and resizing

The toolbar has three tool modes:

* **Free**: move and resize, the general-purpose mode.
* **Move**: drag only.
* **Resize**: handles only.

Positions snap to a 10 pixel grid. Hold **Shift** while dragging to move freely, ignoring the grid. The small arrow next to the tool buttons opens a **Snap** checkbox that turns snapping off entirely.

## Layout: flow and free positioning

Two separate properties decide where a node ends up. Getting these straight saves a lot of confusion.

**Flow** is set on a **container** and decides how it arranges its children:

* **Free**: children stay wherever you put them.
* **Row** / **Row reverse**: children are laid out left to right, or right to left.
* **Column** / **Column reverse**: children are stacked top to bottom, or bottom to top.
* **Wrap children**: lets children spill onto more than one line when they don't fit.

**Ignore Layout Flow** is set on a **child** and decides whether that one node opts out of its parent's arrangement. Off, the parent positions it. On, you pin it yourself with Anchor and Position values.

Two consequences follow from this:

* Drop a widget into a **Free** container and it stays exactly where you dropped it.
* Drop it into a container with a direction and it joins the flow, taking its place in the line.

Switching a container to **Free** pins its existing children where they currently sit, so nothing jumps.

The root of a GUI is always positioned freely.

## Other properties worth knowing

* **Opacity**: 100% is fully opaque, 0% fully transparent. The default is 100%.
* **Scene Inset**: which part of the screen the GUI sits in.
  * **Full Screen** uses the whole renderable screen.
  * **Gameplay Safe Area** stays clear of the client's own interface, such as chat, the minimap, and HUD indicators.
  * **Device Safe Area** also avoids physical obstructions such as a notch or system bars. This option is offered when the canvas is in mobile preview.

If you give a GUI's root a width and a height in fixed pixels, the canvas frames it as an artboard of exactly that size rather than as a screen.

## Check your UI on a phone

The controls in the bottom-right corner of the canvas switch the preview between a desktop screen and a phone. In mobile preview the canvas is drawn inside a phone frame, complete with a notch, so you can see where the screen edges actually fall.

Two sets of guides help you place things where players can see and reach them:

* **Safe-area guides** outline the part of the screen your GUI is confined to, matching the **Scene Inset** you picked. While the Scene Inset is **Device Safe Area** or **Gameplay Safe Area** the outline is always on, because it is what the GUI is clipped to. Set the Scene Inset to **Full Screen** and you can turn the outline on or off with the frame icon button.
* **HUD guides** draw the mobile client's own controls, such as the joystick, the jump and action buttons, the emote wheel, the profile, chat and compass. They are reference only, you cannot select or move them. The game controller button turns them on and off, it only appears in mobile preview, and the guides show by default when the Scene Inset is a safe area.

Content placed outside the safe area is not hidden, it is drawn past the outline. That overflow is the warning: in the real client it would sit under the game's own HUD.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**📔 Note**: These guides are an approximation for the editor only. The real areas are reported by the client at runtime and vary by device, so always confirm on a real phone. See [Preview on mobile](../../build-for-mobile/develop/preview-on-mobile.md).
{% endhint %}

## Customize the mobile controls

On the mobile client, players move and act through a set of native on-screen controls: a joystick, a crosshair, and a row of action buttons. The **MobileHUD** entry lets you reshape that HUD without writing code, and shows the result on the canvas as you go.

Once your scene has at least one GUI, **MobileHUD** appears as the first row of the **GUIs** list, above your own GUIs. Select it to open its panel on the right.

[Screenshot: The UI Editor with MobileHUD selected in the GUIs list, showing the Hide Joystick, Hide Crosshair and Hide Input Actions checkboxes and the Input Actions rows on the right panel, with the mobile HUD drawn on the canvas]

Three checkboxes at the top hide whole parts of the HUD:

* **Hide Joystick**: removes the movement stick.
* **Hide Crosshair**: removes the aiming reticle.
* **Hide Input Actions**: removes every action button at once.

Below them, the **Input Actions** section lists the eight buttons, in the order they fill the on-screen slots:

| Action | Button on screen |
| --- | --- |
| `IA_JUMP` | The large central button, by default |
| `IA_POINTER` | The interaction button |
| `IA_PRIMARY (E)` | The E button |
| `IA_SECONDARY (F)` | The F button |
| `IA_ACTION_3 (1)` to `IA_ACTION_6 (4)` | The numbered buttons |

Each row gives you three things:

* **Main**: a radio button that makes this action the large central button. `IA_JUMP` is Main by default, and only one action can be Main at a time.
* An **eye icon** that shows or hides that button. When you hide one, the lower buttons move up to fill the gap.
* **Custom Icon**: replaces the button's glyph with a `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg` image from your scene.

By default nothing is hidden and `IA_JUMP` is the main button, which is exactly what players get in a scene that doesn't touch the HUD.

{% hint style="info" %}
**💡 Tip**: The numbered buttons normally sit behind a "+" overflow toggle. Hide enough of the higher buttons and they show directly. See [On-screen Controls](../../sdk7/interactivity/touch-screen-controls.md#how-the-button-layout-works) for how the slots fill.
{% endhint %}

### The file it writes

Your changes are written to `src/mobile-hud.ts`, which exports a `setupMobileHud()` function built on the SDK's [`TouchScreenControls`](../../sdk7/interactivity/touch-screen-controls.md) component:

```ts
import { engine, InputAction, TouchScreenControls } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

export function setupMobileHud() {
  TouchScreenControls.createOrReplace(engine.RootEntity, {
    hideJoystick: true,
    hideCrosshair: false,
    mainAction: InputAction.IA_PRIMARY,
    touchInputs: [
      { inputAction: InputAction.IA_ACTION_3, hide: true },
    ],
  })
}
```

The editor also adds the import and the call to your `src/index.ts`:

```ts
import { setupMobileHud } from './mobile-hud'

setupMobileHud()
```

The file only exists while it has something to say. If you set everything back to its default, or delete your last GUI, the Creator Hub deletes `src/mobile-hud.ts` and removes those two lines again.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**📔 Note**: While **MobileHUD** is selected the widget palette is disabled and the preview controls are hidden, since there is nothing to place and the HUD is mobile-only. Select one of your own GUIs to get them back.
{% endhint %}

## Where the files go

The UI Editor edits your scene's real source files. There is no separate saved format.

* Each GUI is one `.tsx` file under `src/ui/`.
* `src/ui/index.tsx` is generated by the editor to gather them together. Don't edit it by hand.
* `src/mobile-hud.ts` holds your [mobile controls](#customize-the-mobile-controls), if you changed any. It sits outside `src/ui/` on purpose, so it's never treated as a GUI.

If your scene has an older single `src/ui.tsx` file, the editor backs it up as `src/ui.tsx.bak` the first time you open the UI Editor.

Because these are ordinary files, you can open them in your [code editor](../code/overview.md) at any time. See [UI](../../sdk7/2d-ui/) for what the underlying code does.

## Code the editor can't edit

The editor understands a particular shape of UI code. A node written some other way, for example built inside a loop or a conditional, or using a custom component or spread props, is drawn on the canvas as a grey block with a **non-standard, edit in code** badge. Its children are not shown, and you edit it in code instead.

The rest of the GUI around it keeps working normally.
