# Audio Analysis

The `AudioAnalysis` component reads real-time data from an audio source playing in your scene, so you can drive visuals from the music. Each frame, it reports an overall **amplitude** value and **8 frequency bands** (low to high) you can use to scale, color, or animate entities.

Common uses:

- Cubes that bounce on the bass.
- Lights that pulse with the beat.
- Equalizer-style bar visualizers.
- Reactive materials or scaled props that match the music.

`AudioAnalysis` is a read-only feed — your scene only consumes the values, the runtime fills them in. It works on entities that play audio through an [AudioSource](../3d-essentials/sounds.md), an [AudioStream](audio-streaming.md), or the audio of a [VideoPlayer](video-playing.md).

## Minimal example

The following scene plays a sound, attaches `AudioAnalysis` to the same entity, and scales a cube on every frame using the audio's amplitude.

```ts
import {
  engine,
  Transform,
  MeshRenderer,
  AudioSource,
  AudioAnalysis,
  AudioAnalysisView,
} from "@dcl/sdk/ecs";
import { Vector3 } from "@dcl/sdk/math";

export function main() {
  // Play a sound on an entity
  const audioEntity = engine.addEntity();
  Transform.create(audioEntity);
  AudioSource.create(audioEntity, {
    audioClipUrl: "sounds/music.mp3",
    playing: true,
    loop: true,
  });

  // Attach AudioAnalysis to the same entity to start receiving analysis data
  AudioAnalysis.createAudioAnalysis(audioEntity);

  // A reusable view object that the component will write into each frame
  const analysis: AudioAnalysisView = {
    amplitude: 0,
    bands: new Array<number>(8),
  };

  // A cube that pulses with the audio amplitude
  const cube = engine.addEntity();
  MeshRenderer.setBox(cube);
  Transform.create(cube, { position: Vector3.create(8, 1, 8) });

  // Each frame, read the latest analysis values and scale the cube
  engine.addSystem(() => {
    AudioAnalysis.readIntoView(audioEntity, analysis);
    const s = 1 + analysis.amplitude * 10;
    Transform.getMutable(cube).scale = Vector3.create(s, s, s);
  });
}
```

The key calls are:

1. `AudioAnalysis.createAudioAnalysis(entity)` — attaches the component to the entity that owns the `AudioSource`, `AudioStream`, or `VideoPlayer`. Defaults to logarithmic mode (see [Modes](#modes)).
2. `AudioAnalysis.readIntoView(entity, analysis)` — copies the latest `amplitude` and 8 `bands` values into a view object you provide.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**📔 Note**: Always pre-allocate the `bands` array with **8 elements** before you call `readIntoView`. The component does not resize the array for you.
{% endhint %}

## Reading the data each frame

`AudioAnalysis` is designed to be read once per frame from a system. The recommended pattern is:

1. Allocate a single `AudioAnalysisView` object once.
2. In a system, call `readIntoView` to refresh it.
3. Use the values directly, or share the view between several systems.

```ts
const analysis: AudioAnalysisView = {
  amplitude: 0,
  bands: new Array<number>(8),
};

engine.addSystem(() => {
  AudioAnalysis.readIntoView(audioEntity, analysis);
  // analysis.amplitude and analysis.bands[0..7] now hold the latest values
});
```

If the analyzed entity might not yet have an `AudioAnalysis` component (for example, it's created later or removed dynamically), use `tryReadIntoView` instead. It returns `false` when the component is missing, and `true` when values were written.

```ts
engine.addSystem(() => {
  if (!AudioAnalysis.tryReadIntoView(audioEntity, analysis)) return;
  // safe to use analysis here
});
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**💡 Tip**: It's cheaper to call `readIntoView` once and let multiple systems share the same view object than to read the component repeatedly.

## React to specific frequency bands

The 8 bands cover the audible spectrum from low to high. `bands[0]` is the lowest (bass) and `bands[7]` is the highest (treble). You can drive different entities from different bands to build a classic equalizer.

```ts
import {
  engine,
  Transform,
  MeshRenderer,
  Material,
  AudioSource,
  AudioAnalysis,
  AudioAnalysisView,
  Schemas,
} from "@dcl/sdk/ecs";
import { Color4, Vector3 } from "@dcl/sdk/math";

// Custom component to mark each bar and remember which band it tracks
const VisualBar = engine.defineComponent("visual-bar", {
  index: Schemas.Number,
});

const BARS_HEIGHT = 12;

export function main() {
  const audioEntity = engine.addEntity();
  Transform.create(audioEntity);
  AudioSource.create(audioEntity, {
    audioClipUrl: "sounds/music.mp3",
    playing: true,
    loop: true,
  });
  AudioAnalysis.createAudioAnalysis(audioEntity);

  const analysis: AudioAnalysisView = {
    amplitude: 0,
    bands: new Array<number>(8),
  };

  // Create 8 bars, one per band
  for (let i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    const bar = engine.addEntity();
    VisualBar.create(bar, { index: i });
    Transform.create(bar, { position: Vector3.create(4 + i, 0, 8) });
    MeshRenderer.setBox(bar);
    Material.setPbrMaterial(bar, { albedoColor: Color4.Yellow() });
  }

  // Read once per frame
  engine.addSystem(() => {
    AudioAnalysis.readIntoView(audioEntity, analysis);
  });

  // Scale each bar with its band
  engine.addSystem(() => {
    for (const [entity] of engine.getEntitiesWith(VisualBar, Transform)) {
      const index = VisualBar.get(entity).index;
      const transform = Transform.getMutable(entity);
      transform.scale = Vector3.create(
        1,
        analysis.bands[index] * BARS_HEIGHT,
        1
      );
    }
  });
}
```

This is the same pattern used in the [audio-visualization example scene](https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-goerli-plaza/tree/main/audio-visualization), trimmed to the essentials.

## Modes

`AudioAnalysis` supports two analysis modes, set when you create the component:

- `PBAudioAnalysisMode.MODE_LOGARITHMIC` (default): values are scaled with a logarithmic curve, which feels closer to how human hearing perceives volume changes. Best for visual reactivity.
- `PBAudioAnalysisMode.MODE_RAW`: the unprocessed amplitude and FFT band values. Use this if you want to apply your own scaling.

```ts
import { AudioAnalysis, PBAudioAnalysisMode } from "@dcl/sdk/ecs";

// Use raw values
AudioAnalysis.createAudioAnalysis(audioEntity, PBAudioAnalysisMode.MODE_RAW);
```

### Tuning the logarithmic mode

In logarithmic mode you can pass two optional gain multipliers:

- `amplitudeGain` — multiplier applied to the overall amplitude. Defaults to `5`.
- `bandsGain` — multiplier applied to all 8 bands. Defaults to `0.05`.

Higher gains make the values more reactive; lower gains make them subtler.

```ts
// Stronger amplitude reaction, gentler band reaction
AudioAnalysis.createAudioAnalysis(
  audioEntity,
  PBAudioAnalysisMode.MODE_LOGARITHMIC,
  10, // amplitudeGain
  0.03 // bandsGain
);
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**📔 Note**: `amplitudeGain` and `bandsGain` only apply in logarithmic mode. In raw mode they're ignored.
{% endhint %}

## Replace an existing component

`createAudioAnalysis` fails if the entity already has an `AudioAnalysis` component. To swap modes or gains at runtime, use `createOrReplaceAudioAnalysis`, which has the same signature.

```ts
// Switch to raw mode mid-scene
AudioAnalysis.createOrReplaceAudioAnalysis(
  audioEntity,
  PBAudioAnalysisMode.MODE_RAW
);
```

## Component reference

### `AudioAnalysis.createAudioAnalysis(entity, mode?, amplitudeGain?, bandsGain?)`

Attaches an `AudioAnalysis` component to `entity`. Fails if a component is already present.

- `entity` (`Entity`): the entity that owns the `AudioSource`, `AudioStream`, or `VideoPlayer` you want to analyze.
- `mode` (`PBAudioAnalysisMode`, optional): `MODE_LOGARITHMIC` (default) or `MODE_RAW`.
- `amplitudeGain` (`number`, optional): logarithmic-mode amplitude multiplier. Default `5`.
- `bandsGain` (`number`, optional): logarithmic-mode bands multiplier. Default `0.05`.

### `AudioAnalysis.createOrReplaceAudioAnalysis(entity, mode?, amplitudeGain?, bandsGain?)`

Same as above, but replaces an existing `AudioAnalysis` component on the entity instead of failing.

### `AudioAnalysis.readIntoView(entity, out)`

Reads the latest values into `out`. Throws if `entity` does not have an `AudioAnalysis` component.

- `entity` (`Entity`): the entity with the component.
- `out` (`AudioAnalysisView`): a view object you provide. Must have `bands` pre-allocated with 8 numbers.

### `AudioAnalysis.tryReadIntoView(entity, out): boolean`

Same as `readIntoView`, but returns `false` if the entity has no `AudioAnalysis` component instead of throwing. Returns `true` when values are written.

### `AudioAnalysisView`

A plain object you allocate to receive the analysis data:

```ts
type AudioAnalysisView = {
  amplitude: number; // overall signal strength
  bands: number[]; // 8 frequency bands, low (0) to high (7)
};
```

## Notes and limitations

- **8 bands, fixed.** The number of frequency bands is fixed at 8. There is no API to request more or fewer bands.
- **One audio source per analysis.** Each `AudioAnalysis` component analyzes the audio from the entity it is attached to. To analyze several sources, attach `AudioAnalysis` to each one.
- **Paused audio reports no updates.** When the underlying audio is stopped or paused, the component values stop changing. Your last-read values remain in your view object until the audio plays again.
- **Cheap, but not free.** Per-frame analysis is designed to be inexpensive (sub-millisecond per source on desktop). Avoid attaching `AudioAnalysis` to many sources at once if you don't need the data. Remove the component when a visualizer isn't visible.
