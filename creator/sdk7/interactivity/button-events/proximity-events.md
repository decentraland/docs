# Proximity Events

Proximity interactions let entities react to button events when a player enters is near and roughly facing it, without requiring them to aim their cursor at the entity.

Traditional pointer events use ray-casting: the player must aim their cursor at an entity's collider before they can press a button to trigger the event. Proximity events instead check for entities that are inside a given area around the avatar, regardless of where the player's cursor is aiming at.

The interactive area considered for proximity interactions is a wide triangular slice of a sphere, projecting forward from the player's position. Unlike with pointer events, the direction that the avatar is facing is important, independently of the direction that the camera is facing.


## Register proximity callbacks

The `pointerEventsSystem` includes helper functions for proximity events, following the same pattern as [pointer event callbacks](register-callback.md).

### Proximity button presses

Use `pointerEventsSystem.onProximityDown` to detect button presses while the player is within range. Unlike `onPointerDown`, this does not require the player to aim their cursor at the entity.

```ts
pointerEventsSystem.onProximityDown(
    {
        entity: myEntity,
        opts: {
            button: InputAction.IA_PRIMARY,
            hoverText: 'Press E',
            maxPlayerDistance: 5,
        },
    },
    function () {
        console.log('Player pressed button near entity')
    }
)
```

Use `pointerEventsSystem.onProximityUp` to detect when the player releases a button while in range.

```ts
pointerEventsSystem.onProximityUp(
    {
        entity: myEntity,
        opts: {
            button: InputAction.IA_PRIMARY,
            hoverText: 'Release E',
            maxPlayerDistance: 5,
        },
    },
    function () {
        console.log('Player released button near entity')
    }
)
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**📔 Note**: Only one `onProximityDown` and one `onProximityUp` can be registered per entity. Once added, they keep listening until removed. Do not call these within a system loop, as that would keep rewriting the behavior.
{% endhint %}

## Proximity event types

Two new values have been added to the `PointerEventType` enum:

* `PET_PROXIMITY_ENTER`: Triggered when the player walks within the entity's proximity range.
* `PET_PROXIMITY_LEAVE`: Triggered when the player moves out of the entity's proximity range.

These can be used with a `PointerEvents` component and the `inputSystem` for the [system-based approach](system-based-events.md#proximity-events). That approach also supports proximity button presses using the `InteractionType.IT_PROXIMITY` field.

## Priority

When multiple entities are within range and could respond to the same input, only one is activated, the closest one by default. Use the `priority` field to control which one takes precedence. Entities with a **higher number** as their priority value respond first.

If the player is both within the range of an entity with a proximity interaction and the player's cursor is pointing at an entity that has a pointer interaction, the entity with the pointer interaction is always given priority. Again, only one entity is activated.


```ts
pointerEventsSystem.onProximityDown(
    {
        entity: doorEntity,
        opts: {
            button: InputAction.IA_PRIMARY,
            hoverText: 'Open door',
            maxPlayerDistance: 5,
            priority: 2,
        },
    },
    function () {
        console.log('Door activated')
    }
)

pointerEventsSystem.onProximityDown(
    {
        entity: floorEntity,
        opts: {
            button: InputAction.IA_PRIMARY,
            hoverText: 'Step here',
            maxPlayerDistance: 5,
            priority: 1,
        },
    },
    function () {
        console.log('Floor activated')
    }
)
```

In the example above, if both entities are within range, the door entity responds because it has the higher priority.

The `priority` field can also be set in the properties of a `PointerEvents` component.

## Options

The proximity helper functions accept the same options as their pointer counterparts:

* `button`: Which button to listen for. See [Pointer buttons](click-events.md#pointer-buttons) for supported options.
* `maxDistance`: Maximum distance from the player's **camera** to the entity, in meters.
* `maxPlayerDistance`: Maximum distance from the player's **avatar** to the entity, in meters. This is the most relevant setting for proximity events.
* `hoverText`: Text to display in the UI when the player is near the entity.
* `showHighlight`: If true, shows an edge highlight on the entity when the player is in range. _true_ by default.
* `showFeedback`: If true, shows hover feedback, hovering around the center of the entity. _true_ by default.
* `priority`: Resolves conflicts when multiple entities are in proximity. Higher values take precedence. If multiple entities have the same priority value, the closest one is picked.


## Remove callbacks

To remove a proximity callback, use the corresponding remove function:

```ts
pointerEventsSystem.removeOnProximityDown(myEntity)
pointerEventsSystem.removeOnProximityUp(myEntity)
pointerEventsSystem.removeOnProximityEnter(myEntity)
pointerEventsSystem.removeOnProximityLeave(myEntity)
```

Once removed, the entity is no longer reactive to that proximity event.


## Proximity enter and leave

Use `pointerEventsSystem.onProximityEnter` to run a callback when the player walks into the entity's proximity range, and `pointerEventsSystem.onProximityLeave` when they walk out. This can be used to display extra feedback hints to the player, for example a sound or an animation when an item can be interacted with.

```ts
pointerEventsSystem.onProximityEnter(
    {
        entity: myEntity,
        opts: {
            button: InputAction.IA_POINTER,
            hoverText: 'Nearby',
            maxPlayerDistance: 5,
        },
    },
    function () {
        console.log('Player entered proximity')
    }
)

pointerEventsSystem.onProximityLeave(
    {
        entity: myEntity,
        opts: {
            button: InputAction.IA_POINTER,
            hoverText: 'Nearby',
            maxPlayerDistance: 5,
        },
    },
    function () {
        console.log('Player left proximity')
    }
)
```


## Example: proximity door

The following example opens or closes a door when the player presses a button while standing nearby, without needing to aim at the door.

```ts
const doorPivot = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(doorPivot, { position: Vector3.create(3, 0, 4) })

const door = engine.addEntity()
GltfContainer.create(door, { src: 'assets/door.glb' })
Transform.create(door, { position: Vector3.create(-1, 0, 0), parent: doorPivot })

let isDoorOpen = false
const closedRot = Quaternion.fromEulerDegrees(0, 0, 0)
const openRot = Quaternion.fromEulerDegrees(0, 90, 0)

pointerEventsSystem.onProximityDown(
    {
        entity: door,
        opts: {
            button: InputAction.IA_PRIMARY,
            hoverText: 'Open / Close',
            maxPlayerDistance: 5,
            priority: 1,
        },
    },
    function () {
        if (isDoorOpen) {
            Tween.setRotate(doorPivot, openRot, closedRot, 700)
            isDoorOpen = false
        } else {
            Tween.setRotate(doorPivot, closedRot, openRot, 700)
            isDoorOpen = true
        }
    }
)
```
